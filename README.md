# CorePad

Corepad is a simple notepad made with Tauri + Svelte. This was a practice project to reorganize my scope and breakdown the neccessary components for my other project [Nucleus](https://github.com/mellobacon/Nucleus).

If you want to try it out, you can [download it here](). Keep in mind that this was made for Windows only and there are not plans for other OS support at this time.
